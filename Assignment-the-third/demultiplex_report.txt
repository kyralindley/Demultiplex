Using demultiplexing.py, I was able to simulatanously read four fastq files and demultiplex the reads and their indexes into the following categories:
*matched indexes 
*hopped indexes
*unknown indexes.

The percentage of reads from each sample can be seen in the matched_instaces.txt

The percentage of reads with matched indexes can be see in the hopped_instances.txt.Index Swapping occured 0.19% of the time.

The percentage of reads that were matched, hopped, and unknown are:
*matched: 91%
*hopped: 0.19% 707740 
*unknown:8.5% 30783962.
The total number of reads was 363246735.
