Pseudo code for demultiplexing

Define a function that reverse compliments barcdodes
    Make it into a dictionary,I will call it compliment_dictionary 
        The key is one letter of genetic code
        The value is its corresponding base pair 
        Ex.... {A:T,T:A, G:C, C:G} 
    Then i will reverse the order of the sequence, then make the changes to the code 


I will the open all four files and read them, in a while true loop i will do these four things, ordering from least computationally intesnse to most computationally
    with open (all 4 files, "r") as f1,f2,f3,f4:
        while true
            *extract sequence line & header (f1,f4)
            header=line
            sequence=line
            *do same on file 3, but call our reverse compliment function on the sequence line of these 
                *if N is present in sequence line or not in list of index: send to unknown
                *elif:
                    add the index-index to both fw and rv if fw_barcode=rv_barcode: send to dual matched 

                *elif: 
                    fw!=rv AND index in list: send to index hopped
